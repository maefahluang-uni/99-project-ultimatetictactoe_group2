 Overview

Project Introduction


Welcome to our project, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe. In this project, we modified the traditional 9 grids to 9 big grids with 9 small girds in each summing up to overall 81 small grids. 

Procedures
-----------

There will be two players: player X and player O. Each of them have two choices: either sign-up or log-in. Signing up the name will give the player the ID for later logging in the game again. The log-in option will ask for the ID the system has already generated the first time they have played the game.

After asking for the information, the game will start, and it is ready to be played.

Conditions:
------------

The determination of victory involves a meticulous count of symbols within the expansive large grids, considering diagonal, vertical, and horizontal alignments. In cases where a decisive winner remains elusive at the level of individual large grids, the game pivots to comparing the total count of large grids conquered by each player. The one with the greater count emerges victorious. In the rare circumstance of an equal count, the game gracefully concludes in a tie.

Prepare for an immersive journey where strategic prowess and skillful play define the path to crowning the ultimate champion in Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.
